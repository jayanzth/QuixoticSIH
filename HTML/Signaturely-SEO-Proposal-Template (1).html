<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Introduction <br/>Your company needs to have a strong digital presence in this digital world. The best way to <br/>achieve online success is by having a solid SEO strategy. <br/> <br/>SEO can help you increase your organic traffic and get highly-qualified users to discover your <br/>website and learn about what you have to offer. With a good SEO strategy, your website can <br/>reach far more viewers for much longer than any ads of the same price could. <br/> <br/>According to our research, the implementation of a good SEO strategy can help you increase <br/>organic page views and visits by up to 20% in just six months and even more with additional <br/>strategies. <br/> <br/>If you have any questions or comments about this proposal, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me <br/>by responding to the email this proposal was attached to. <br/></p>
<p>About Us <br/>The Ranking Consultant Agency is a company dedicated to helping startups reach their targeted <br/>audience and increase their online visibility. <br/> <br/>Started in 2012 by three friends, The Ranking Consultant Agency has grown to employ over 25 <br/>people on-site and across the world, which enables us to employ the best talent at competitive <br/>prices. <br/> <br/>At The Ranking Consultant Agency, we assist start-ups through data-based decisions, starting <br/>with thorough research, establishing goals, and letting you know how much you can increase <br/>your visibility and how to increase and maintain your level of traffic. <br/> <br/>Our company has helped over 100 brands increase their traffic exclusively through SEO, and <br/>we&#8217;re ready to do the same for you. <br/></p>
<p>Our Approach <br/>At The Ranking Consultant Agency, we start our process by establishing where your company <br/>is at. This means looking into how your company is doing on SEO, like the amount of organic <br/>traffic you&#8217;re already getting, which keywords your website is currently ranking for, and which <br/>are your most important keywords overall. <br/> <br/>We&#8217;ll also verify if there are any potential issues with your website that&#8217;s keeping you from <br/>ranking, and how to solve them. This will help us establish a baseline. <br/> </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Establishing a baseline is extremely important because it lets us know where we are, and allows <br/>us to create realistic and achievable goals.  <br/> <br/>It also helps us discover any potential issues that might be preventing your company from <br/>achieving its goals. We can then solve these in order to start on a solid foundation. <br/> <br/>Once we establish your baseline and your needs we will start developing your SEO strategy and <br/>supervise it to fruition. <br/> <br/>Here&#8217;s what our auditing process looks like: <br/></p>
<p>1. Laying the groundwork <br/>We begin the process by using various tools to crawl your website. These tools let us collect the <br/>information we need to learn how well your website is currently ranking. <br/> <br/>We also check your analytics to discover trends and patterns about your traffic and use the free <br/>Google Webmasters diagnostic tools. <br/> <br/>Once we have collected all the data we need, we start the audit process. <br/></p>
<p>2. Discovering your website&#8217;s accessibility <br/>By using the data we&#8217;ve collected, we will learn how well search engines are currently able to <br/>crawl and access your website. We look for potential issues in your website&#8217;s metadata, <br/>sitemaps, site architecture, navigation, and framework. <br/> <br/>This lets us know two things: how well search engines can access your website and how well <br/>search engines can understand your website. <br/> <br/>Finally, we check your site&#8217;s performance&#8212;how fast it loads on a computer or smartphone. <br/></p>
<p>3. Finding out your indexability <br/>Once we make sure search engines can access and understand your website, we need to make <br/>sure they can index it too. <br/> <br/>&#8220;Indexing&#8221; means search engines are including your website in their results when someone <br/>looks up relevant information. <br/> <br/>This part is very simple to do. We search various queries on Google and Bing and find out how <br/>many of the pages from your website are included in the results. <br/> <br/>If any pages can&#8217;t be accessed, we&#8217;ll offer solutions to help you index them. </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>4. On-page optimization <br/>Once we&#8217;ve ensured your website is indexed and SEO-friendly, we dig into the rest of the <br/>factors that determine your ranking. <br/> <br/>We consider factors such as: <br/></p>
<p>&#9679; URLs <br/>&#9679; Content <br/>&#9679; Duplicate Content <br/>&#9679; Keyword Cannibalism <br/>&#9679; HTML markup <br/>&#9679; Interlinking <br/></p>
<p>These factors will help us find even more ways to improve your ranking. <br/></p>
<p>5. Off-page optimization <br/>When it comes to ranking, what&#8217;s not on your website is just as important as what is on it. Your <br/>website needs to have high-quality sites linking to it. These links, or backlinks, help determine <br/>your page authority. <br/> <br/>Here, we review your website&#8217;s popularity compared to your competition, your backlinks and <br/>their sources, how trustworthy your website is, as well as your Page Authority and Domain <br/>Authority. Based on this analysis, we take action and start building links to your site through <br/>different tactics. <br/></p>
<p>6. Competition analysis <br/>Once we&#8217;ve reviewed everything there is to review about your website, we&#8217;ll also review three of <br/>your competitors&#8217; websites and compare the results. <br/> <br/>Finally, we determine the actions that need to be taken to increase your website&#8217;s ranking. <br/></p>
<p>Issues <br/>In reviewing your website, we&#8217;ll learn about any issues it may have. These can include the <br/>following: <br/></p>
<p>Missing Alt Tags and Broken Images <br/>Images must always be fully responsive since broken images are bad for SEO. However, since <br/>Google can&#8217;t see the images, it relies on alt tags to know what the image represents.  <br/> <br/>Alt tags help search engines understand what images are about and their relevance to the <br/>content. </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Meta Descriptions Issues <br/>Meta descriptions help users decide whether they should click on your website when they find it <br/>on a search engine. If your meta descriptions aren&#8217;t attractive enough, users may look <br/>elsewhere. The fewer clicks your website gets, the lower the search engine will rank it. <br/> <br/>By providing relevant meta descriptions, you ensure users will click on your website and help <br/>your website rank higher. <br/></p>
<p>Low Word Count <br/>When it comes to SEO, there's no minimum word count; however, words help search engines <br/>understand the purpose of a page. <br/> <br/>And it&#8217;s not just about how many words are written either. Google in particular seems to prefer <br/>deep and valuable content, rather than fluff. <br/> <br/>Your content should be as long as it needs to be to convey the right information, without any <br/>unnecessary repetition or rephrasing. <br/></p>
<p>Broken Internal and External Links <br/>Having broken links can be extremely damaging for your SEO. While a couple of broken links <br/>are usually not a big problem, the more your website contains, the less friendly it will appear to <br/>both users and search engines. <br/> <br/>This is especially true of search engines because they don&#8217;t typically crawl your whole website <br/>at one time. So the more broken links you have, the more likely it is that a search engine won&#8217;t <br/>find the content it is looking for. <br/></p>
<p>Objectives &amp; Solutions <br/>Based on the issues above, we can decide which path to take to fix any problems and help your <br/>website rank even higher. <br/> <br/>Here are the proposed objectives and solutions for your website: <br/></p>
<p>Improve meta descriptions <br/>We need to ensure all pages have a proper meta description that&#8217;s both informative and <br/>relevant to the rest of the page. <br/> <br/>To achieve this, we need to keep meta descriptions at a limit of 155 characters to ensure as <br/>much information is conveyed without anything getting cropped out. <br/> </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>We should also improve meta descriptions to make them sound actionable by making sure they <br/>all have a proper CTA. Finally, we need to ensure the meta descriptions include the most <br/>important keyword, all while matching the rest of the content. <br/></p>
<p>Fix image issues <br/>Next, we need to ensure your website&#8217;s images have the proper tags and are fully functional. <br/> <br/>All alt tags should describe images using less than 125 characters. They should also use <br/>relevant keywords when possible. <br/></p>
<p>Increase word count <br/>Not all pages need to contain a lot of content. However, we need to ensure all pages have <br/>enough content to fully inform users and search engines of their purpose. <br/> <br/>To achieve this, we need to find pages with content issues and improve the text in them without <br/>using any unnecessary words. The text should be easy to read, easy to scan, and to the point. <br/></p>
<p>Fix broken links <br/>We need to find every broken link. These broken links will be tracked on a spreadsheet.  <br/> <br/>We will then find the relevant active links to replace each of the broken links, which will also help <br/>with interlinking. <br/></p>
<p>Create an SEO campaign <br/>The final and most important step of this process is the creation of an SEO campaign. Our SEO <br/>team will build a framework so you can increase your rankings and organic traffic. This <br/>framework will increase new visitors and maintain regular visitors while giving you an edge over <br/>the competition. <br/></p>
<p>Past Projects &amp; Achievements <br/>Here&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve helped other users in the past: <br/></p>
<p>Case Study: Local Photographer <br/>Jennifer Doe had had her photography studio for over three years, and in spite of her business <br/>being successful, she was struggling to obtain online traffic. Although her website was running, <br/>barely any users were visiting it. </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Proposed Solution <br/>We started by identifying the types of clients she wanted to target. Although many people visited <br/>her studio, she wanted to target more weddings and enable clients to find her online and have <br/>her shoot on location. <br/> <br/>We audited her website, which had few but important issues. Once her website had been <br/>audited and fully optimized, we started performing competition research to find out which <br/>keywords users were using in their searches. <br/> <br/>When we got the right keywords, we developed a plan to help users find her more easily: We <br/>optimized the content she already had with the right keywords, and we developed more content <br/>to target those keywords. <br/> <br/>We rewrote 75% of her website content, so the content would be far more friendly and targeted. <br/>We then created a blog to target even more long-tail keywords and allow her to display more <br/>about her work and process. <br/></p>
<p>Result <br/>Within the first month, she had already received 4 highly-qualified leads that ended up <br/>converting and purchasing wedding packages. By the end of the six months, she had received <br/>55 queries from highly-qualified users who had found her page organically. <br/> <br/>&#8220;I started without knowing anything about SEO. The Ranking Consulting Agency not only fixed <br/>everything that needed fixing but gave me the tools to keep up my website&#8217;s success.&#8221; <br/>Jeniffer Doe, professional photographer. <br/></p>

<p>Giving you the attention you need <br/>We don&#8217;t accept every customer that shows up. Instead, we&#8217;re very careful about selecting our <br/>customers.
